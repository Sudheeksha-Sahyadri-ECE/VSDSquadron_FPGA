# UART Loopback Mechanism Implementation

## Objective:
The goal of this project is to implement a UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter) loopback mechanism, which allows for the immediate reception of transmitted data. This functionality is useful for testing and verifying UART communication on FPGA boards.

## Overview:
UART is a commonly used protocol for serial communication. It utilizes two primary data lines: TX (Transmit) and RX (Receive). In a loopback configuration, the transmitted data on the TX pin is routed directly back to the RX pin. This provides a convenient method for testing UART functionality without requiring an external device.

The existing Verilog code can be found [here](https://github.com/Bhavankumar123/VSDSquadron-FPGA-Mini-Internship-program/blob/main/UARTexistingcode.v), sourced from [VSDSquadron_FM](https://github.com/thesourcerer8/VSDSquadron_FM/tree/main/uart_loopback).

## Code Analysis:
The provided Verilog code includes several key components that facilitate the UART loopback mechanism:

### 1. **Port Breakdown:**
   - **RGB LED outputs**: `led_red`, `led_blue`, `led_green`
   - **UART pins**: `uarttx` (Transmit), `uartrx` (Receive)
   - **Clock input**: `hw_clk`

### 2. **Internal Components:**
   - **Oscillator (SB_HFOSC)**: Provides the internal clock signal (`int_osc`).
   - **Frequency Counter**: A 28-bit counter that increments on the positive edge of the internal clock, providing a timing reference for the system.
   - **UART Loopback**: Direct connection between the TX and RX pins for data transmission and reception.
   - **RGB LED Driver (SB_RGBA_DRV)**: Converts the received UART data into PWM signals for controlling LED brightness.

### 3. **System Operation:**
   - **UART Communication**: The received data is immediately transmitted back out, and the same data is used to control the RGB LEDs.
   - **LED Control**: The UART data drives all three LEDs with PWM signals.
   - **Timing and Frequency Generation**: The internal oscillator and frequency counter generate the required timing for the system.
